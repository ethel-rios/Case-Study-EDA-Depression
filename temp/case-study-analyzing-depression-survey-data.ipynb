Mental Health Professionals: On-campus counselors, psychologist\n   - Relevance: Directly involved in student mental health\n   - Using insights to tailor interventions and enhance support programs.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

Each row corresponds to an individual, while the columns capture the factors that might contribute with depression:\n\n- *Note: All scales used in this dataset are on a 1–5 range, where 1 represents minimal and 5 represents maximum, except for CGPA, which follows a 1–10 scale.*\n\n    1.

Because students who report both depression and suicidal thoughts are at higher risk of self-harm or suicide. This represents a critical mental health warning sign that requires immediate attention.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Load packages","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library('tidyverse')\nlibrary('janitor')\nlibrary('dplyr')\nlibrary('ggplot2')","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.077593Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.079205Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.097534Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.095612Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Read data and explore","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"depression <- read.csv('/kaggle/input/depression-surveydataset-for-analysis/final_depression_dataset_1.csv')\nhead(depression)\nglimpse(depression)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.104301Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.105760Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.177090Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.175317Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Applying clean_names, Renaming Columns, Adjusting Variables to Appropriate Types and add a New Column ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"depression_clean <- depression %>%\n  clean_names() %>%  # Clean column names\n  rename(            # Renaming columns\n    suicidal_thoughts = have_you_ever_had_suicidal_thoughts,\n    fam_hist_mental_illness = family_history_of_mental_illness,\n    study_hours = work_study_hours,\n    student = working_professional_or_student\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(  # Convert chr to factor\n    gender = factor(gender), \n    dietary_habits = factor(dietary_habits), \n    fam_hist_mental_illness = factor(fam_hist_mental_illness),  \n    study_satisfaction = factor(study_satisfaction),\n    depression = factor(depression), \n    academic_pressure = factor(academic_pressure),\n    financial_stress = factor(financial_stress)\n  )%>%\n  mutate( # Add a new column that indicates whether both the depression and suicidal_thoughts columns are marked as 'Yes'\n    depression_suicidal = ifelse(depression == \"Yes\" & suicidal_thoughts == \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"No\")  \n  )\n\nglimpse(depression_clean)\ncolnames(depression_clean)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.310600Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.312224Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.377701Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.375921Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Filter dataset to include only students and drop unnecessary columns","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"depression_clean <- depression_clean %>% \n  filter(student == \"Student\") %>%\n  select(\n      -\"profession\",\n      -\"work_pressure\",\n      -\"job_satisfaction\",\n      -\"city\",\n      -\"degree\",\n      )\n\nglimpse(depression_clean)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.380628Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.382298Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.412377Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.410447Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Check for missing values and duplicates ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#missing values\ndepression_clean %>% \n  is.na()%>%  #Check for NA (missing) values, creating a logical matrix\n  colSums()   #Sum the TRUE values (which represent missing values) for each column\n\n#duplicates\nsum(duplicated(depression_clean)) #Count the number of duplicate rows\n\n#summary statistics\nsummary(depression_clean)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.528154Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.529721Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.572132Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-03T01:58:50.570382Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Analyze and Share Phase\nOrganize and format the data to answer the questions.
